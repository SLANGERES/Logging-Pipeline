# Cross-Language Logging & Monitoring Pipeline

This project demonstrates a **unified logging and monitoring pipeline** for microservices written in different languages (Python, Go, Java). It ensures consistent logging, centralized observability, and real-time monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

---

## 🔹 Features
- **Cross-Language Support** – Standardized JSON-based structured logging across Python, Go, and Java services.
- **Centralized Logging** – Logs collected via **Fluent Bit / Logstash** and stored in **Elasticsearch / Loki** for easy querying.
- **Metrics & Monitoring** – Application metrics exposed via **Prometheus exporters** for real-time tracking.
- **Visualization & Alerting** – **Grafana dashboards** for log correlation, performance insights, and system alerts.
- **Improved MTTR** – Faster debugging and issue resolution through unified observability.


---

## ⚙️ Setup
1. **Run Services** – Start sample services in Python, Go, and Java with structured JSON logging.
2. **Deploy Log Collector** – Configure **Fluent Bit** or **Logstash** to forward logs to **Elasticsearch / Loki**.
3. **Set Up Prometheus** – Scrape metrics exposed by each service.
4. **Configure Grafana** – Import dashboards for logs, metrics, and alerts.

## 📊 Example Dashboards
- Service latency & throughput
- Error rate and exception tracking
- Log correlation across microservices
- System resource utilization

---

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Microservices observability in polyglot environments  
- Production-grade monitoring with logs + metrics correlation  
- Faster root cause analysis (RCA) and performance tuning
